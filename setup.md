You need to download some files to follow this lesson:

1. Download [data-shell.zip]({{ page.root }}/data/data-shell.zip) and move
the file to your public_html.
2. Unzip/extract the file (ask your instructor if you need help with this
step).  You should end up with a new folder called **data-shell** on your
Desktop.
3. Type `cd`, then press the Enter key.  That last step will make sure you
start with your home folder as your working directory.

In the lesson, you will find out how to access the data in this folder.
